        Hey you.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy New Year 🥂  
        I don’t really know how to start letters properly, so I’ll just say this the way I feel it.
      </p>

      <p>
        I love the random chaya kudi trips we go on — no plans, no rush, just us sitting there,
        talking about everything and nothing at the same time. Those moments feel weirdly sacred to me.
        Like life slowing down just enough to remind me why I’m here.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve watched you grow — not loudly, not for show — but in the most real way.
        The way you think, the way you handle things, the respect you give people without expecting anything back.
        You’ve grown stronger mentally, kinder emotionally, and yeah — you glow differently now.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s been this long, and my gut has never been wrong about you.
        You’re the only woman I want to build a future with — the boring days, the hard days,
        the days where nothing makes sense and the days that feel perfect for no reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know how much you hate men (valid tbh),
        so thank you for giving me the chance to be different —
        to grow, to unlearn, to show up better in whatever ways I can.
        That trust means more to me than you’ll ever know.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you feels calm. Safe. Like home.
        And if this year is just another chapter of us being us,
        then I already know it’s going to be a good one.
      </p>

      P.S. I made this myself, by the way.  
      I know. I’m a cool boyfriend.
