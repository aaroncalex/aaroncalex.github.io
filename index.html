        Hey.
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy New Year..  
        I don’t really know how to write letters properly, so I’m just going to say things the way they come.
      </p>

      <p>
        I think a lot about the random chaya kudi we go to.. no plans, no pressure, just us sitting there,
        talking about life, people, nonsense, and sometimes nothing at all.
        Those moments stay with me more than the big ones.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve seen how much you’ve grown.. mentally, emotionally, and as a person.
        The way you think things through now, the respect you give people, the boundaries you protect.
        It’s quiet growth, but it’s powerful.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s been this long, and my gut has never once doubted you.
        You’re the only woman I want to build a life with..
        not just the good days, but the boring ones, the tired ones, and the days where nothing feels certain.
      </p>

      <p>
        I know how much you dislike men, and honestly, I get why.
        So thank you for trusting me enough to give me space in your world..
        to let me try, learn, and be better in the ways that matter.
        That means more to me than you probably realize.
      </p>

      <p>
        Loving you feels steady.
        It feels calm.
        It feels like something I don’t want to run from or rush past.
        And if this year is just another chapter of us growing together,
        then I already know it’s going to be worth it.
      </p>
